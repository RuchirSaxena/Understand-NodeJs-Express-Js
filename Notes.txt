Introduction
=================
1.Javascript runtime built on chrome's V8 javascript engine
2.Javascript runnig on serve
3.Used to build powerfull , fast and scalabe web applications
4.Uses an event-driven , non-blocking I/O model

Non-Blocking I/O 
===================
1.Works on as single thread using non-blocking I/O calls
2.Suppuorts tens of thousands concurrent connections
3.Optimizes throughput and scalability in web appications with many I/O operations
4.This makes Node.js apps extremely fast and efficient

Event Loop
============
single threaded
Supports concurrency via events and callbacks
EventEmitter class is used to bind events and event listeners


    EventEmitters => events1 ,event 2... => Event Loop  => Event Handlers

WhAT CAN WE BUILD with Node JS?
==================================
1.Rest APIs and Backend applications
2.Real-Time Services(chat,Games etc.)
3.Blogs , CMS, Social applications
4.Utilities and tools
5.Anything that is not CPU-intensive    

Popular modules of Node JS
==============================
Express =>Web Development Framework
Connect =>Extensible HTTP server Framework
Socket.io =>Server side component for webscokets
Pug/Jade =>Template engine inspired by HAML
Mongo/Mongoose =>Here Mongo Db is a no SQL Dtabase and Mongoose is an ORM (Object Relational Mapper)
Coffee-Script -CoffeeScript is a compiler , basically its a superset of javascript similar to that of typescript
Redis-Redis client Library (No-sql database ) also a caching system
